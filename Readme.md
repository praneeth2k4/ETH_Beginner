# Mint and Burn Token

Mint and Burn Token - Token Contract

## Description

The Mint and Burn Token project provides a simple  token contract called "MyCustomToken" that supports minting and burning of tokens. The contract allows for the creation of new tokens (minting) and the destruction of existing tokens (burning). Additionally, it keeps track of token balances for different addresses.

Minting tokens increases the total supply of tokens and adds the minted tokens to the balance of a specific address. On the other hand, burning tokens decreases the total supply and deducts the burned tokens from an address's balance.

The contract provides a basic implementation of an token, which can be used as a foundation for building more complex token economies, such as creating utility tokens, governance tokens, or representing digital assets.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To compile and deploy the contract, follow these steps:

1. Open the Solidity compiler.
2. Compile the contract using the appropriate compiler version.
3. Deploy the compiled contract to your preferred Ethereum network or testnet.
